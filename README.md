# LaunchBar Actions

A collection of LaunchBar 6 actions.

## To Do

- Documentation.

## Notes

- The vast majority of the actions are dependency-free — just put them LaunchBar’s actions directory (`~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions/`) and you’re good to go. In other cases, the action’s dependencies are listed in its documentation. 
- When an actions lists a dependency prefixed with `./shared`, it means it excepts that path to exist in LaunchBar actions directory.
