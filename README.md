# launchbar-actions
Various actions for LaunchBar (obdev.at/products/launchbar).

1. Note: some of these actions require the scripts in **Shared Scripts/** to be locally available — that could be achieved by putting them in the same folder as the default script for each action that requires them (a symlink is also valid). A better and somewhat hacky approach is to put them in **/Applications/LaunchBar.app/Contents/Resources/Actions/Shared Scripts**. Then  they’ll globally available to all actions.

2. To do: migrate some actions to Node.js.
