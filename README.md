# LaunchBar Actions

A collection of LaunchBar 6 actions.

## Notes

- The .lbaction bundles are just folders. The source (which is also the executable) of each action is located inside the respective `./Contents/Scripts/` folder of each action.
- Some actions execute compiled Swift programs that may need "Full Disk Access" in System Preferences.
- Actions with a leading underscore are not meant to be run on their own. Rather, they contain code that is shared among other actions. You should hide them in LaunchBar's index.
- Many of the actions require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), installed in `/usr/local/bin`.
- Some actions require additional utilities and/or programs (e.g. [Default Folder X](https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)).
- Some actions are intented to work with my own [Hammerspoon setup](https://github.com/roeybiran/.hammerspoon). Those are prefixed with `hs`.
